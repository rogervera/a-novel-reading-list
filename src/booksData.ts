    author: 'Theodore Dreiser',
    description: 'A novel about a young woman who moves to Chicago and experiences both success and moral decline in the pursuit of material wealth.',
    jim_description: '"Sister" is fashioned after one of Teddy\'s. It\'s too bad Dreiser isn\'t read much anymore, especially by young people, who read not much of anything. Dreiser still tells more about life in America than most writers, even though by now much of his America has vanished--regretfully.',

    jim_description: "This was Maugham's first novel. He wrote it while training to be a doctor. I don't know what his prospects as a doctor were, but his talent as writer and story teller were obvious in Liza of Lambeth, which meant for him, goodbye medicine.\nAfter his literary efforts were over, Maugham left an estate valued at about nine million--at least fifty million now, I guess.",

    author: 'Thomas Wolfe',
    description: "A semi-autobiographical novel about Eugene Gant's coming of age in the fictional town of Altamont, North Carolina, during the early 20th century.",
    jim_description: "A rather long novel. Poetry from the first word to the last. Wolfe was a genius with words, probably more than any other writer here. I don't think there was any confusion in him about what he meant to write in Look Homeward, Angel. His words fill the pages like honey; there's not a sour phrase in all of them.\nWolfe wrote a follow-up volume called 'Of Time and the River.' It begins with the young man's train ride from Altamont (Asheville), North Carolina to Boston and Harvard University-- about a seventy-five page journey. The best, whatever and everything that means, seventy-five novel pages I ever read.",

    title: 'Rabbit, Run',
    author: 'John Updike',
    description: 'A novel about Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom, a former high school basketball star who feels trapped in his marriage and suburban life, leading him to run away from his responsibilities.',
    jim_description: 'In college, it was assiÄ¡ned reading by my favorite professor. He said the first seventy or so pages-- through Rabbit\'s first run -- were flawlessly written. Well, when reading for college, you don\'t have time to really think, but years later, when I reread the book, I easily agreed with him.\n"Rabbit, Run" can be read for itself, but it turned out that Updike, about every ten years, added ten years more of story about Rabbit. He didn\'t originally intend to do this, but "Rabbit, Run" finished open-ended, and provided the opportunity. About the last one hundred pages of the last book, "Rabbit At Rest", were also perfectly written.\nBetween the first and final perfectly written pages about Rabbit\'s life, there aren\'t many dull pages, but nobody can write perfectly all the time. Anyway, the four "Rabbit" books together make a nice history of east-coast life in America from about 1955 to 1990.',

    jim_description: 'Kennedy chronicled the Albany, New York area. Ironweed takes place there during the Great Depression. A very good story and very good writing. Hollywood made a pretty good movie out of Ironweed starring Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, provided you read the book first.',
